Vodafone’s Global Code Like a Girl programme aims to tackle low representation of girls in STEM education and to get more girls into careers that require coding skills, or to help them get a start as STEM entrepreneurs.  

All participants are taught introductory web development skills such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript and are given a task to design and develop a website. Each team then presents their creation to a panel of judges, other students on the programme, and Vodafone employees.
